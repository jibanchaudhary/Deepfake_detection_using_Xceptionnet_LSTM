## **System Workflow**

1. **Input Module**:  
   Accepts video files for analysis.

2. **Pre-Processing Module**:  
   - Extracts frames from video files.  
   - Resizes frames for uniform processing.

3. **Processing Module**:  
   ### **Models Used**  
   - **XceptionNet**:  
     - Extracts spatial features from individual frames.  
     - Uses depthwise separable convolutions for computational efficiency.  
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:  
     - Extracts temporal features across frames.  
     - Effectively handles sequential data, identifying patterns over time.  

4. **Output Module**:  
   Delivers results, categorizing videos as **Real** or **Fake**.
